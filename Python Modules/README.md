This Module will be covering 5 Python Libraries- Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, NLTK and SciKit Learn.  
These modules will facilitate efficient data manipulation and data visualization which is essential for any machine learning task.

# Numpy

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful open-source Python library used for numerical and scientific computing. It provides support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

## Key Features
* Ndarray: Central data structure in NumPy, an efficient multi-dimensional array object.
* Mathematical Operations: Supports element-wise operations, linear algebra, statistics, and more.
* Broadcasting: Automatically expands arrays of different shapes for arithmetic operations.
* Integration: Works seamlessly with other libraries like SciPy, pandas, and matplotlib.
* Performance: Fast and memory-efficient compared to native Python lists.

# Pandas

Pandas is an open-source Python library used for data manipulation, analysis, and cleaning. It provides easy-to-use data structures and functions, making it a powerful tool for working with structured data.

## Key Features
* Data Structures:
  * Series: One-dimensional labeled array.
  * DataFrame: Two-dimensional labeled table (like an Excel spreadsheet or SQL table).
    
* Data Handling:
  * Importing and exporting data from various formats (CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON).
  * Handling missing data (NaN).
  * Filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregation.
  * Merging and joining datasets.
  * Time series support.
