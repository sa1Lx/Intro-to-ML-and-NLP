This Module will be covering 5 Python Libraries- Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, NLTK and SciKit Learn.  
These modules will facilitate efficient data manipulation and data visualization which is essential for any machine learning task.

# Numpy

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful open-source Python library used for numerical and scientific computing. It provides support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

## Key Features
* Ndarray: Central data structure in NumPy, an efficient multi-dimensional array object.
* Mathematical Operations: Supports element-wise operations, linear algebra, statistics, and more.
* Broadcasting: Automatically expands arrays of different shapes for arithmetic operations.
* Integration: Works seamlessly with other libraries like SciPy, pandas, and matplotlib.
* Performance: Fast and memory-efficient compared to native Python lists.
