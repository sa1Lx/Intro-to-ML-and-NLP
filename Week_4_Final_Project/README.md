# Problem Statement

Design and train a transformer-based language model to predict the next word in a given text sequence. This task is foundational in NLP and supports applications such as autocomplete, text generation, and intelligent writing assistants.

## Objectives

1. Build a language model for next-word prediction using transformer architecture.
2. Fine-tune a pre-trained model (e.g., GPT-2) on a textual dataset.
3. Evaluate the model using standard metrics like perplexity and top-k accuracy.
4. Understand and apply best practices for tokenizer alignment, model adaptation, and text preprocessing.

## Datasets

1. General Text Corpora:
   - WikiText-2: Clean Wikipedia articles suitable for structured language learning.
   - OpenWebText: Large-scale web data similar to GPT-2’s pretraining corpus.
2. Domain-Specific Data (Optional):
   - Custom datasets such as academic papers, technical documentation, or support dialogues can be used for specialized modeling.

## Training Steps

1. Data Loading & Tokenization: Load your dataset with `datasets` and tokenize it using `AutoTokenizer`.
2. Model Selection: Use a pretrained model `GPT2LMHeadModel` for next-word prediction.
3. Fine-Tuning: Train the model using the Trainer API or a custom PyTorch loop.
4. Evaluation: Measure performance with the metrics perplexity and top-k accuracy.

## Optional Extensions

1. Explore larger transformer variants for improved accuracy (e.g., gpt2-medium, gpt2-large).
2. Deploy the model with a basic interface using Streamlit or Gradio for interactive demonstrations.
3. Compare transformer-based performance with a baseline LSTM model.

## Explanation of the Code

### 1. Loading the Dataset

 [`Datasets`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/en/index): Datasets is a library for easily accessing and sharing datasets for Audio, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

See all the datasets available on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets).

```python
from datasets import load_dataset_builder
ds_builder = load_dataset_builder("sample-dataset")
```

This helps us to load a dataset builder and inspect a dataset’s attributes without committing to downloading it.

```python
ds_builder.download_and_prepare()
ds = ds_builder.as_dataset
```

* ***`split`***:  A split is a specific subset of a dataset like train and test. List a dataset’s split names with the `get_dataset_split_names()` function. Not using `split` returns a DatasetDict object instead.


### 2. Loading Pre-trained Model and Tokenizer

[`Transformers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index): Transformers is a library for state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing for TensorFlow 2.0 and PyTorch.

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, AutoTokenizer

model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("openai-community/gpt2")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("openai-community/gpt2")
# This loads the pre-trained GPT-2 model and its tokenizer.
```
