# Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. NLP combines computational linguistics with machine learning and deep learning techniques to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. NLP is used in various applications such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, chatbots, and information retrieval. 

# NLP Pipeline Overview
The NLP pipeline consists of several stages that transform raw text into structured data for analysis. The typical stages include:
1. **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing text data (e.g., removing punctuation, converting to lowercase).
2. **Tokenization**: Splitting text into smaller units (tokens) such as words or sentences.
3. **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Assigning grammatical categories to tokens (e.g., noun, verb).
4. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying and classifying named entities in text (e.g., people, organizations).
5. **Dependency Parsing**: Analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences to understand relationships between words.
6. **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the sentiment expressed in text (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
7. **Text Classification**: Assigning predefined categories to text based on its content.
8. **Vectorization**: Converting text into numerical representations (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings).
